          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>I'm a curious and detail-driven Full Stack Developer who enjoys building systems that are not just functional, but secure, efficient, and thoughtfully designed. What draws me to tech is the problem-solving aspect. I enjoy breaking down complex requirements into clean logic, optimising workflows, and understanding why systems behave the way they do. Beyond code, I value clarity, simplicity, and user experience. I enjoy working with Figma and UI/UX principles to ensure what I build feels intuitive and human, not just technically correct. </p>
                    
          <p>I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to complete a one-year internship at Zoho, which played a key role in strengthening my technical foundation, professional discipline, and real-world understanding of software development.</p>
          
          <p>Outside of work, I like to pause and look up. I enjoy spending time watching the sky-during the day and at night-letting my thoughts slow down. It's a habit that keeps me calm and observant. I'm known for my warm smile, something that rarely leaves my face, and I believe in spreading happiness through something as simple and genuine as a smile.</p>
          
          <p>I'm also a national-level Taekwondo player and have completed Level 1 in Silambam, experiences that have shaped my discipline, focus, and resilience—qualities I carry into both my personal life and my work as a developer.</p>
